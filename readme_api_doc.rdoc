<h2>How we handle authentication</h2>
On every call we will need you to send the "api_key". This api_key is the authentication token of the agent that is commiting the request. If the agent is not allowed, we will stop processing the request, and proceed to return a message telling that the agent is not authorized. 
Have in mind that this "api_token" is reseted on every login, and can be obtained using token's POST api method. <a href="TokensController.html">TokensMethods</a>

<h2>Error codes</h2>
We always answer with an string variable called "code". Acording to the method result we will set this "code" variable in order to match the result. (We are answering "000" for success, and with an especific value for each kind of error).
